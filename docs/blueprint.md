## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Neon acid yellow (#D7FF00) for background to establish the brand's raw and edgy aesthetic.
- Background color: Very light yellow (#000000), almost white, derived from the primary to ensure consistency.
- Accent color: A light-green (#FFFFFF) provides a subtle, analogous contrast against the primary background for highlighting key elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif; due to its neutral look, this will ensure code is easily visible when copy/pasted and used.
- Icons: Simple, outline-style icons to maintain a raw, minimalist feel.
- Asymmetric layouts with deliberate misalignment to reinforce the underground aesthetic.
- Subtle entrance animations and hover effects using Framer Motion. Reserved for future implementation.
